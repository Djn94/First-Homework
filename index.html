    <div class="text">
      <p>Born and raised in Houston, Texas, I have been performing on various instruments (most notably bass guitar and contrabass bugle) since I was a young child.
         Although musical studies soaked up much of my time, I did manage to find time for a few extra curricular hobbies, such as dogs, weight lifting and computers.
      </p>

      <p> My early years were marked by my creeping slowly through basic HTML texts, trying to teach myself how the internet worked. Although music does still possess a quantity of my life, the time to branch out in to other interests has come, and coding is what I have picked.
         Affinities for typing and troubleshooting have always been a skill I feel I have wasted..</p>
